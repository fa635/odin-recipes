        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I first had this pesto grilled cheese sandwich at a small restaurant and immediately went home to duplicate the recipe. I've been making my grilled cheese sandwiches this way ever since!</p>
        

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon softened butter, divided</li>
            <li>2 slices Italian bread</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon prepared pesto sauce, divided</li>
            <li>1 slice provolone cheese</li>
            <li>2 slices tomato</li>
            <li>1 slice American cheese</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread butter on one side of a slice of bread and place it, buttered side down, into a nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/2 of the pesto sauce on the unbuttered side of the bread. Stack provolone cheese, tomato, and American cheese on top of pesto, in that order.</li>
            <li>Spread remaining pesto sauce on second slice of bread. Place it pesto side down onto sandwich in the pan. Butter the top side of bread.</li>
            <li>Gently fry sandwich, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and cheese has melted, about 5 minutes per side.</li>
        </ol>
